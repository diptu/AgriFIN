                        <p>To give a detailed description of the database design is the main purpose of this Software Design Specification (SDS) for the “Agriculture Microfiinance” (AMF) software. The document will provide developers an insight in meeting client’s needs efficiently and effectively. Moreover the document facilitates communication and understanding of the system by providing several views of the system design.
                        </p>

                        <li id="1.2">Document Conventions</li>
                        <p>The document has described architectural design of the “Agriculture Microfiinance” (AMF). The high level components and their interactions, suitable architectural patterns, physical arrangement of components and design decisions applied to the whole system
                        The software does not offer any new terminology making it more user friendly. Anybody with experience of using internet is expected to be able to use the software. </p>

                        <li id="1.3">Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</li>
                        <p>This document is intended for all individuals participating in the AMF project. Readers interested in a brief overview of the product should focus on the rest Introduction, as well the Overall Description, which provide a brief overview of each aspect of the project as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Readers who wish to explore the features of AMF in more detail should read the System Features, which expands upon the information laid out in the main overview.

                        <p>The Software design document would explain how the design will fulfill the functional and non- functional requirements captured in the Software Requirement specification (SRS). The document will provide a framework to the programmers through describing the  database design, algorithm design, sub systems, interfaces, architecture and the high level components. This is achieved through the use of architectural patterns, design patterns, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, relational models and user interfaces</p>
