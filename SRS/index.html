   </ol>
            </li>
            <li  id="5">Other Nonfunctional Requirements
              <ol>
                <li id="5.1">Performance Requirements</li>
                <p>Performance should not be an issue because all of our server queries involve small pieces of data. Changing screens will require very little computation and thus will occur very quickly.Server updates should only take a few seconds as long as the phone can maintain a steady signal. The cost-division algorithms used by in application will be highly efficient,takling only a fraction of a second to compute.</p>}</p>
                <li id="5.2">Safety Requirements</li>
                <p> The application will not affect data stored outside of its server nor will it affect any other applications installed on the user's phone.It cannot cause any damage to the phone or its internal components.The only potential safety concern associated with this applicaion applies to virtually all handset apps:This app shouldnot be used while operating a vehicle or in any other situation where the user's attention must be focused elsewhere.</p>
                <li id="5.3">Security Requirements</li>
                <p>This application assumes that only the user or whoever he/she allows will have access to his/her android handset.With that being said,Google email address is required to verify the identity of the user upon opening the app.Also it is protected by password.The user needs to verfy that he is a farmer and need to enter the app by a registration process,which will keep information about his personal details and he has to register his name in the government list as a farmer.So he have to register in the app by his registation farmer number.  </p>
                <li id="5.4">Software Quality Attributes</li>
                <p>The graphical user interface of the app is to be designed with usability as the first priority.The app will be presented and organized in a manner that is visually appealing and easy to navigate.There will be feedbacks and visual cues such as notifications to inform users of updates and pop-ups to provide users with instructions.To maintain flexibility and adaptability,the app will take into account situations in which a user loses internet connection or for watever reason cannot establish a connection with the server.These user will still be able to use the application but any transactions etc. posted while disconnected will be cached until the connection is restored.</p>
                <li  id="5.5">Business Rules</li>
                <p> Transaction will be done by bank acount,mastercard,bikash.Transperacy will be maintained by both buyers and farmers.Buyers and farmers can easily access to all informations.A team of expertise will monitor the budget and swot(strength,weakness,oppourtunities and threats). Which will be beneficial for both organization and buyer in the long run.</p>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li id="6">Other Requirements</li>
            {Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections that are pertinent to the project.}
          </ol>
          <h2 id="AppA">Appendix A: Glossary</h2>
          <p>{Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to a single project in each SRS.}</p>
          <h2 id="AppB">Appendix B: Analysis Models</h2>
          <p>{Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship diagrams.}</p>
          <h2 id="AppC">Appendix C: To Be Determined List</h2>
          <p>{Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.}</p>
