                <li id="1.1">Purpose </li>
                <p>The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Agriculture
                    Microfiinance” (AMF) software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the
                    development of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other
                    external applications. This document is primarily intended to be a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team</p>
                <li id="1.2">Document Conventions</li>
                <p>The software does not offer any new terminology making it more user friendly. Anybody with experience of using internet is expected to be able to use the software. </p>
                <li id="1.3">Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</li>
                <p>This document is intended for all individuals participating in the AMF project. Readers interested in a brief overview of the product should focus on the rest Introduction, as well the Overall Description, which provide a brief overview of each aspect of the project as a whole.</p>
                <p>Readers who wish to explore the features of AMF in more detail should read the System Features, which expands upon the information laid out in the main overview. Part 3 `(External Interface Requirements) offers further technical details, including information on the user interface as well as the hardware and software platforms on which the application will run.
                </p>
                <li id="1.4">Product Scope</li>
                <p>The AMF system aims to create opportunities for mass population to invest on agriculture.
The system is composed of a client side application which will run on both android and web.
They system is designed to facilitate the process of crowd funding. Potential scenerios include paying online, data visualization, previous season's transactins etc. More information is given below.</p>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li id="2">Overall Description
              <ol>
                <li id="2.1">Product Perspective</li>
                <p>The product is a standalone software and not an additonal package.
This is a new system compared to traditional agriculture financing systems.</p>
                <li id="2.2">Product Functions</li>
                <p>The product is a software which allows farmers to get investment.
It allows investors to make small scale investment in agriculture.
It allows us to predict future profit margins based on previous data of transactions
It allows us to assess risk when it comes to making investment in agriculture.</p>
                <li id="2.3">User Classes and Characteristics</li>
                <p>There are mainly two two types of users.
Farmers can open accounts and post new business incentives.
Investors can look up profit margins and risk factors for different crops as well as make investments</p>
                <li id="2.4">Operating Environment</li>
                <p>The primary source of interaction is an Android app, which allows an any user to use the product without much technological knowledge. However a webiste serves as the backend of the app and can be acceseed via any browser.Design and Implementation Constraints</p>
                <li id="2.5">Design and Implementation Constraints</li>
                <p>Implemantation at a large scale required human resourse as agents in user level where developers have a very few option to make an impact if there is any . To implemet our prediction or recommended system needs large data set for better accuracy . </p>
                <li id="2.6">User Documentation</li>
                <p>An SRS is uploaded as an html file which allows users to look up different parts of the software as well as get more sources for information.</p>
                <li id="2.7">Assumptions and Dependencies</li>
                <p>Fraud farmers are susceptible to high risk, as there is no guarantee of fair financial transactions without verification.
Investments are subjected to market risks. Natural disasters and other factors can be devastating to the agriculture industry.Avertaisment can leads to earn revinew </p>
