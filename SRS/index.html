                <li id="1.3">Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</li>
                <p>This document is intended for all individuals participating in the AMF project. Readers interested in a brief overview of the product should focus on the rest Introduction, as well the Overall Description, which provide a brief overview of each aspect of the project as a whole.</p>
                <p>Readers who wish to explore the features of AMF in more detail should read the System Features, which expands upon the information laid out in the main overview. Part 3 `(External Interface Requirements) offers further technical details, including information on the user interface as well as the hardware and software platforms on which the application will run.
                </p>
                <li id="1.4">Product Scope</li>
                <p>The AMF system aims to create opportunities for mass population to invest on agriculture.
The system is composed of a client side application which will run on both android and web.
They system is designed to facilitate the process of crowd funding. Potential scenerios include paying online, data visualization, previous season's transactins etc. More information is given below.</p>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li id="2">Overall Description
              <ol>
                <li id="2.1">Product Perspective</li>
                <p>The product is a standalone software and not an additonal package.
This is a new system compared to traditional agriculture financing systems.</p>
                <li id="2.2">Product Functions</li>
                <p>The product is a software which allows farmers to get investment.
It allows investors to make small scale investment in agriculture.
It allows us to predict future profit margins based on previous data of transactions
It allows us to assess risk when it comes to making investment in agriculture.</p>
                <li id="2.3">User Classes and Characteristics</li>
                <p>There are mainly two two types of users.
Farmers can open accounts and post new business incentives.
Investors can look up profit margins and risk factors for different crops as well as make investments</p>
                <li id="2.4">Operating Environment</li>
                <p>The primary source of interaction is an Android app, which allows an any user to use the product without much technological knowledge. However a webiste serves as the backend of the app and can be acceseed via any browser.Design and Implementation Constraints</p>
                <li id="2.5">Design and Implementation Constraints</li>
                <p>Implemantation at a large scale required human resourse as agents in user level where developers have a very few option to make an impact if there is any . To implemet our prediction or recommended system needs large data set for better accuracy . </p>
                <li id="2.6">User Documentation</li>
                <p>An SRS is uploaded as an html file which allows users to look up different parts of the software as well as get more sources for information.</p>
                <li id="2.7">Assumptions and Dependencies</li>
                <p>Fraud farmers are susceptible to high risk, as there is no guarantee of fair financial transactions without verification.
Investments are subjected to market risks. Natural disasters and other factors can be devastating to the agriculture industry.Avertaisment can leads to earn revinew </p>

You may prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the most logical sense for your product.}</p>
              <ol>
                  <li id="4.1">System Feature 1
                    <p>{Don’t really say “System Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few words.}</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Description and Priority</li>
                      <p>{Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).}</p>
                      <li>Stimulus/Response Sequences</li>
                      <p>{List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements associated with use cases.}</p>

Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary information is not yet available.}</p>
                      <p>{Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a meaningful tag of some kind.}</p>
                      <p>REQ-1:</p>
                      <p>REQ-2:</p>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li  id="4.2">System Feature 2 (and so on)</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li  id="5">Other Nonfunctional Requirements
              <ol>
                <li id="5.1">Performance Requirements</li>
                <p>Performance should not be an issue because all of our server queries involve small pieces of data. Changing screens will require very little computation and thus will occur very quickly.Server updates should only take a few seconds as long as the phone can maintain a steady signal. The cost-division algorithms used by in application will be highly efficient,takling only a fraction of a second to compute.</p>}</p>
                <li id="5.2">Safety Requirements</li>
                <p> The application will not affect data stored outside of its server nor will it affect any other applications installed on the user's phone.It cannot cause any damage to the phone or its internal components.The only potential safety concern associated with this applicaion applies to virtually all handset apps:This app shouldnot be used while operating a vehicle or in any other situation where the user's attention must be focused elsewhere.</p>
                <li id="5.3">Security Requirements</li>
                <p>This application assumes that only the user or whoever he/she allows will have access to his/her android handset.With that being said,Google email address is required to verify the identity of the user upon opening the app.Also it is protected by password.The user needs to verfy that he is a farmer and need to enter the app by a registration process,which will keep information about his personal details and he has to register his name in the government list as a farmer.So he have to register in the app by his registation farmer number.  </p>
                <li id="5.4">Software Quality Attributes</li>
                <p>The graphical user interface of the app is to be designed with usability as the first priority.The app will be presented and organized in a manner that is visually appealing and easy to navigate.There will be feedbacks and visual cues such as notifications to inform users of updates and pop-ups to provide users with instructions.To maintain flexibility and adaptability,the app will take into account situations in which a user loses internet connection or for watever reason cannot establish a connection with the server.These user will still be able to use the application but any transactions etc. posted while disconnected will be cached until the connection is restored.</p>
                <li  id="5.5">Business Rules</li>
                <p> Transaction will be done by bank acount,mastercard,bikash.Transperacy will be maintained by both buyers and farmers.Buyers and farmers can easily access to all informations.A team of expertise will monitor the budget and swot(strength,weakness,oppourtunities and threats). Which will be beneficial for both organization and buyer in the long run.</p>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li id="6">Other Requirements</li>
            {Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections that are pertinent to the project.}
          </ol>
          <h2 id="AppA">Appendix A: Glossary</h2>
          <p>{Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to a single project in each SRS.}</p>
          <h2 id="AppB">Appendix B: Analysis Models</h2>
          <p>{Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship diagrams.}</p>
          <h2 id="AppC">Appendix C: To Be Determined List</h2>
          <p>{Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.}</p>
