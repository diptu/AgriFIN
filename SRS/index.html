                        <p>The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Agriculture Microfiinance” (AMF) software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration
                            for the development of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other external applications. This document is primarily intended to be a reference for developing the first version of
                            the system for the development team</p>
                        <li id="1.2">Document Conventions</li>
                        <p>The software does not offer any new terminology making it more user friendly. Anybody with experience of using internet is expected to be able to use the software. </p>
                        <li id="1.3">Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</li>
                        <p>This document is intended for all individuals participating in the AMF project. Readers interested in a brief overview of the product should focus on the rest Introduction, as well the Overall Description, which provide a brief
                            overview of each aspect of the project as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Readers who wish to explore the features of AMF in more detail should read the System Features, which expands upon the information laid out in the main overview. Part 3 `(External Interface Requirements) offers further technical
                            details, including information on the user interface as well as the hardware and software platforms on which the application will run.
                        </p>
                        <li id="1.4">Product Scope</li>
                        <p>The AMF system aims to create opportunities for mass population to invest on agriculture. The system is composed of a client side application which will run on both android and web. They system is designed to facilitate the process
                            of crowd funding. Potential scenerios include paying online, data visualization, previous season's transactins etc. More information is given below.</p>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                        <p>The product is a standalone software and not an additonal package. This is a new system compared to traditional agriculture financing systems.</p>
                        <li id="2.2">Product Functions</li>
                        <p>The product is a software which allows farmers to get investment. It allows investors to make small scale investment in agriculture. It allows users to predict future profit margins based on previous data of transactions It allows
                            users to assess risk when it comes to making investment in agriculture.</p>

                        <p>The primary source of interaction is an web app, which allows an any user to use the product without much technological knowledge. However an android application extends the usability of the software. </p>
                        <li id="2.5">Design and Implementation Constraints</li>
                        <p>Implemantation at a large scale required human resourse as agents in user level where developers have a very few option to make an impact if there is any . To implemet our prediction or recommended system needs large data set for
                            better accuracy . </p>
                        <li id="2.6">User Documentation</li>
                        <p>A Software Requirements and Specification(SRS) file is uploaded as an html file which allows users to look up different parts of the software as well as get more sources for information.</p>
                        <li id="2.7">Assumptions and Dependencies</li>
                        <p>A department will invest on every details of transaction, as there is no guarantee of fair financial transactions without verification. Investments are subjected to market risks. Natural disasters and other factors can be devastating to the
                            agriculture industry. Advertisements can lead to earn revenue. </p>

                </li>
                <li id="5">Other Nonfunctional Requirements
                    <ol>
                        <li id="5.1">Performance Requirements</li>
                        <p>Performance should not be an issue because all of our server queries involve small pieces of data. Changing screens will require very little computation and thus will occur very quickly.Server updates should only take a few seconds
                            as long as the phone can maintain a steady signal. The cost-division algorithms used by in application will be highly efficient,takling only a fraction of a second to compute.</p>
                        <li id="5.2">Safety Requirements</li>
                        <p> The application will not affect data stored outside of its server nor will it affect any other applications installed on the user's phone.It cannot cause any damage to the phone or its internal components.The only potential safety
                            concern associated with this applicaion applies to virtually all handset apps:This app shouldnot be used while operating a vehicle or in any other situation where the user's attention must be focused elsewhere.</p>
                        <li id="5.3">Security Requirements</li>
                        <p>This application assumes that only the user or whoever he/she allows will have access to his/her android handset.With that being said,Google email address is required to verify the identity of the user upon opening the app.Also
                            it is protected by password.The user needs to verfy that he is a farmer and need to enter the app by a registration process,which will keep information about his personal details and he has to register his name in the government
                            list as a farmer.So he have to register in the app by his registation farmer number. </p>
                        <li id="5.4">Software Quality Attributes</li>
                        <p>The graphical user interface of the app is to be designed with usability as the first priority.The app will be presented and organized in a manner that is visually appealing and easy to navigate.There will be feedbacks and visual
                            cues such as notifications to inform users of updates and pop-ups to provide users with instructions.To maintain flexibility and adaptability,the app will take into account situations in which a user loses internet connection
                            or for watever reason cannot establish a connection with the server.These user will still be able to use the application but any transactions etc. posted while disconnected will be cached until the connection is restored.</p>
                        <li id="5.5">Business Rules</li>
                        <p> Transaction will be done by bank acount,mastercard,bikash.Transperacy will be maintained by both buyers and farmers.Buyers and farmers can easily access to all informations.A team of expertise will monitor the budget and swot(strength,weakness,oppourtunities
                            and threats). Which will be beneficial for both organization and buyer in the long run.</p>
