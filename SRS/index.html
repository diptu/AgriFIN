              <ol>
                <li id="1.1">Purpose </li>
                <p>The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Agriculture
                    Microfiinance” (AMF) software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the
                    development of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other
                    external applications. This document is primarily intended to be a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team</p>
                <li id="1.2">Document Conventions</li>
                <p>The software does not offer any new terminology making it more user friendly. Anybody with experience of using internet is expected to be able to use the software. </p>
                <li id="1.3">Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</li>
                <p>This document is intended for all individuals participating in the AMF project. Readers interested in a brief overview of the product should focus on the rest Introduction, as well the Overall Description, which provide a brief overview of each aspect of the project as a whole.</p>
                <p>Readers who wish to explore the features of AMF in more detail should read the System Features, which expands upon the information laid out in the main overview. Part 3 `(External Interface Requirements) offers further technical details, including information on the user interface as well as the hardware and software platforms on which the application will run.
                </p>
                <li id="1.4">Product Scope</li>
                <p>The AMF system aims to create opportunities for mass population to invest on agriculture.
The system is composed of a client side application which will run on both android and web.
They system is designed to facilitate the process of crowd funding. Potential scenerios include paying online, data visualization, previous season's transactins etc. More information is given below.</p>
              </ol>

              <ol>
                <li id="2.1">Product Perspective</li>
                <p>{Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.}</p>
                <li id="2.2">Product Functions</li>
                <p>{Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.}</p>
                <li id="2.3">User Classes and Characteristics</li>
                <p>{Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.}</p>
                <li id="2.4">Operating Environment</li>
                <p>{Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.}</p>
                <li id="2.5">Design and Implementation Constraints</li>
                <p>{Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).}</p>
                <li id="2.6">User Documentation</li>
                <p>{List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.}</p>
                <li id="2.7">Assumptions and Dependencies</li>
                <p>{List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).}</p>
