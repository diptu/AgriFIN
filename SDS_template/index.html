			User log in: Here the User can create their own account.
			Search for details: Here the user can search about a land ,which will be suitable for cultivation.
			Book Land: Here the user will buy a suitable share of land based on their ability.
			All typs of information will be saved in our database so that the next time the user log in to the database ,they get the similiar suggestion and donot need to put their information over and over again.

            <p>{Use this section to motivate any decisions that will help the reader understand the design that your team is using. This section can also capture good ideas that were abandoned and the reasons for leaving them out of the design.}</p>
